Here we have basically done few things

First we learned how to generate API using Flask

Second we created a model.py and integrated on top of this model our API Flask

Third learnt about Docker concepts and did a Wsl1 to Wsl2 upgrade

NOTE: My computer has two linux Distro -> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS(Wsl1) upgraded to Wsl2 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Wsl2). The former comes with python 3.8 pre installed and latter comes with python 3.6 preinstalled.

My local system has 3 python versions -> 3.10,3.8,3.7

This has no connection with Wsl python preinstalled and can be found seperately if you type \\wsl$ in file explorer

Wsl1 and Wsl2 cant run simultaneously one has to upgrade and degarde according to their preference of projects.

However upon upgrade of Wsl1 to Wsl2 no changes were made however there is a speed decrease in server allocation/ run

Fourth build and pushed a docker image of this ML-Api into docker hub
